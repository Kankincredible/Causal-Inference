## Introduction

Causal inference is the process of drawing conclusions about the causal relationship between variables based on observational data. This is a critical aspect of research in many fields, as it allows researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms driving observed phenomena and make informed policy recommendations or interventions.

This repository aims to provide a solid foundation for those interested in learning about causal inference and its applications, as well as serve as a reference for experienced researchers who wish to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
